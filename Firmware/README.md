"test_encoder_blinking" - Testing code - link LED several times after power up, and then blinking LED when encoder event occurs.   
"test1_capture_image" - Testing code - capture image from linear image sensor and send it to PC.  
"test2_capture_image" - Testing code - the same as "test1_capture_image" but laser is ON most of the time. This is MORE dangerous for eyes than "test1_capture_image"!  
"lidar4_main_code" - Main LIDAR firmware.  

UART protocols are described here: https://github.com/iliasam/OpenSimpleLidar/wiki/Lidar-UART-Protocol  
  
IAR 7.50 could be used for building projects.  
You can find already build HEX files at the "EWARM/Output/Exe" folders.
